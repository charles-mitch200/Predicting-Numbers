# Predicting Numbers
## Overview
This GitHub repository houses a machine learning project focused on predicting numerical digits using logistic regression. The project leverages the load_digits dataset from scikit-learn, aiming to build a predictive model for recognizing handwritten digits.

## Project Highlights
* **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
* **Dataset:** The project utilizes the load_digits dataset from scikit-learn, containing a collection of hand-written digits.
* **Accuracy Assessment:** Evaluation of model performance and accuracy in predicting numerical digits.

## Contents
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The main project file is a Jupyter notebook that guides you through the entire process, from loading and exploring the dataset to training the logistic regression model and evaluating its performance.
* **Dataset:** Information on how to access and load the load_digits dataset from scikit-learn for reproducibility.

## Usage
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open and run the Jupyter notebook to explore the project interactively.
* Follow the step-by-step guide to understand the logistic regression model's implementation and performance on the digits dataset.
* Feel free to experiment, contribute, or use the findings for your own projects!

## Requirements
